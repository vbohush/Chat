Chat for a local network
========

Goal: implement simple chat server and client.

Requirements:

1. ~~Server should handle at least 5 clients~~

2. ~~Server should support Unicode (at least english/russian language).~~

3. ~~Server should be configured via config files. Following settings should be present: ip, port, max users count.~~

4. ~~Client should be able to send/receive simple Unicode messages to all users in chat.~~


Optional features:

1. Server should have a log system/gather statistic.

2. ~~Client should be able to send messages to a specific user (private messages).~~

3. Support both TCP/UDP mode. Additional bonus for non-server mode: client uses broadcast/multicast for sending messages to other clients.

4. ~~Chat users can have different access priviledges (admin/user, admin is able to ban user).~~

5. ~~Chat client should support rich text features (font styles, colors).~~

6. ~~Configure server using GUI.~~
